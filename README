NAME
    emph - emphasise matching lines with colour

SYNOPSIS
     emph PATTERN...

DESCRIPTION
    This program operates similarly to grep(1). It takes input from stdin,
    and colours any lines that match a regex described by one of the
    arguments. Multiple patterns may be specified, and each one will receive
    a different colour (well, there are 12 colours; they repeat after that).

    Patterns specified sooner will match sooner and prevent matching of
    later patterns. For example:

      $ emph foo bar < file

    Lines containing "foo" will be red, and lines containing "bar" but NOT
    "foo" will be green, and other lines will not be coloured.
