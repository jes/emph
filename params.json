It takes input from stdin,\r\nand colours any lines that match a regex described by one of the\r\narguments. Multiple patterns may be specified, and each one will receive\r\na different colour (well, there are 12 colours; they repeat after that).\r\n\r\nPatterns specified sooner will match sooner and prevent matching of\r\nlater patterns. For example:\r\n\r\n    $ emph foo bar < file\r\n\r\nLines containing \"foo\" will be red, and lines containing \"bar\" but NOT\r\n\"foo\" will be green, and other lines will not be coloured.\r\n\r\n## AUTHOR\r\nJames Stanley <james@incoherency.co.uk>\r\n\r\n","tagline":"Emphasise matching lines with colour.","note":"Don't delete this file!
